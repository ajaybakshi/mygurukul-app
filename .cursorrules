# Always Worksâ„¢ Implementation Rules
- Every code change must be immediately testable
- No "trust me, it works" commits
- 30-second verification before moving forward
- Embarrassment test: "Would I be comfortable showing this to a user?"

# CRITICAL GIT PROTECTION RULES
# This project has an existing Git repository - DO NOT REINITIALIZE

## FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - NEVER RUN THESE:
- git init (WILL DESTROY EXISTING REPOSITORY)
- rm -rf .git (WILL DESTROY HISTORY)
- git reset --hard (WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL)

## REQUIRED GIT WORKFLOW:
1. ALWAYS check "git status" before any git operations
2. NEVER run "git init" - repository already exists
3. IF git commands fail, STOP and ask user before proceeding
4. For git issues, suggest manual terminal operations instead

## SAFE GIT OPERATIONS ONLY:
- git status (check repository state)
- git add . (stage files)
- git commit -m "message" (commit changes)
- git log --oneline (view history)
- git branch (check branches)

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOL:
If git operations fail or show errors:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report the exact error to user
3. Suggest manual terminal approach
4. NEVER attempt to "fix" by reinitializing

## PROJECT CONTEXT:
This is a valuable Sanskrit AI project with 40+ tagged milestones including revolutionary v2.0.0-sanskrit-revolution. Destroying the git history would be catastrophic.
