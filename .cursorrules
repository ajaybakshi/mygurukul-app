# Always Works™ Implementation Rules
- Every code change must be immediately testable
- No "trust me, it works" commits
- 30-second verification before moving forward
- Embarrassment test: "Would I be comfortable showing this to a user?"
- "Always verify working directory before git commands:
pwd should show /Users/AJ/Desktop/mygurukul-app"
